This tool helps analyse the data of individual rowing boats after a piece and can also simulate side-by-side racing between boats competing in a time trial event like a head race.



Notes:

Very unfinished  - just uploaded so others can have a go
Untested on other devices - may not necessarily work on laptops other than my own (especially macs)
Not easy to use.  Due to its original nature as a analysis tool for personal use its not easy to setup and use.


Instructions :  

1. You need to obtain a suitable GPX file from the piece . The only tested file format that works so far is by uploading the activity to strava then downloading it from the activity page using https://mapstogpx.com/strava/ 

2 . If the activity data encompasses the whole session this may not work well in the tool particularly if  you done multiple laps of the same route. To split up the full GPX file into multiple tracks I recommend : https://gpx.studio . When exporting the track from the website you must make sure to include timestamps otherwise it wont work.

3. Select the files you just exported in the program and try it out.
